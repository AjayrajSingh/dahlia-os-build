## Which Script Do I Use?

- fuchsia build scripts can be found in the FuchsiaOS-Build directory.
   These scripts can be used for running a vannila version of fuchsia, or for testing the build
   system before installing a full version of dahlia.

- the dahlia build scripts cna be found in the DahliaOS-Build directory
   #### the scripts are not currently functional. the latest commit broke them, please remain patient while we sort this out.
